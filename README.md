# Buffer-Overflow
This repository contains an example of how a buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited using Python. The goal is to get access to the flag that is being read from 'flag.txt'.
'exploit.py' is the code of our exploit.
'task1' is the code that is being exploited with exploit.py.
'task1.c' is the source code of 'task1'.
'flag.txt' contains the flag.
